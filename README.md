# My Coding Practice Startup Script

## About This Project

This repository contains a simple shell script (`startup.sh`) that I use to kick off my coding practice sessions. It's a fun way for me to see a collection of the different algorithms and data structures I'm currently learning about.

## Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the script demonstrates:

- **Pyramid Pattern**: A simple nested loop exercise to print a pyramid of stars.
- **BFS/DFS Placeholders**: Conceptual printouts for Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search traversals. I plan to implement these with a proper graph structure soon.
- **Sliding Window**: An implementation of the sliding window technique to find the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.

## How to Run

If you want to see it in action:

```sh
# Make the script executable
chmod +x startup.sh

# Run it!
./startup.sh
```

## Future Ideas

- Implement BFS and DFS with a real graph data structure.
- Add more sorting algorithms.
- Explore dynamic programming concepts.
